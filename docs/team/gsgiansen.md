### Project: lesSON

lesSON is a desktop flashcard application for Computing students in University who struggle with
memorisation and consolidation of knowledge. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a
GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: Displaying ui with updated Card class
  * What it does: Card class now is able to showcase the question and hides the answer
  * Justification: Showcases the functionality of the Card class and allows user to practise
  * Highlights: Questions are now listed in one deck together

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=gsgiansen&breakdown=true)
